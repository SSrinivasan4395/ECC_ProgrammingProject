"""
Movie Theater Ticket System
---------------------------
This project shows list of movies show in the theaters.
Once the user selects a movie, shows the choice of the day that user want to purchase for.
Based on user's choice of the day, shows the show times. For the current day it will display only future shows times that are left for the day.
Get the number of tickets that the user wants under each category Adult/Child/Senior, calculates the price and reduce the number of available seats in the system.
Calculate price based on Peak day or Normal day (10% more from base price), Child 30% discount and Senior 25% discount and 6% tax on the total order.
Monday-Thursday are normal days. Friday, Saturday and Sunday are Peak rate days.
Finally it will display movie ticket summary on the screen.
